            Here's what I'm not about:
            <br>
            I'm not just RANDOM GUY who attended GENERIC SCHOOL and worked at COMPANY.
            <br>
            Here's what I am:
            <br>
            I am at heart passionate about all that I do. I cognitively function outside the box, I push the limits of convention, and I traverse avenues most wouldn't dare to access.
            <br>
            I hold a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Mathematics, with a concentration in the research fields of computational chemistry, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. In my time as an engineer at TRUE, I invented and developed the patent-pending Audit product, or TRUE Data Verification, which automates the auditing of mortgage loans in record time with high accuracy.
            <br>
            I have specific passions for AI, video game programming, VR, genetic algorithms, and cryptography. In my spare time (of which I have little) I enjoy reading, poetry writing, skateboarding, fumbling with a guitar, and preaching endlessly the virtues of quilted toilet paper.

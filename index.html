                For the image above, I used the :hover pseudo-class to make the image react in a dramatic way when the user hovers over it. I employed the properties transform and box-shadow to achieve this effect. Transform is a property that allows you to scale, rotate, or translate an element. Box-shadow is a property that allows you to add a shadow to an element. By employing both of these, I created a 3D effect that makes the image turn and have a glowing shadow when the user hovers over it.

            <p>
                Here's what I'm not about:
                <br>
                I'm not just RANDOM GUY who attended GENERIC SCHOOL and worked at COMPANY.
                <br>
                Here's what I am:
                <br>
                I am at heart passionate about all that I do. I cognitively function outside the box, I push the limits of convention, and I traverse avenues most wouldn't dare to access.
                <br>
                I hold a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Mathematics, with a concentration in the research fields of computational chemistry, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. In my time as an engineer at TRUE, I invented and developed the patent-pending Audit product, or TRUE Data Verification, which automates the auditing of mortgage loans in record time with high accuracy.
                <br>
                I have specific passions for AI, video game programming, VR, genetic algorithms, and cryptography. In my spare time (of which I have little) I enjoy reading, poetry writing, skateboarding, fumbling with a guitar, and preaching endlessly the virtues of quilted toilet paper.

            <h2>Video Recommendations</h2>
            <p>
                The internet is home to a panoply of content, but there are some real diamonds in the rough if you know where to look. Here are some S-tier YouTube video recommendations that will make you laugh, cry, and ponder. 
                <br>
                To create these embedded YouTube videos, I employed the help of the iframe tag. This HTML tag is a cool way to embed HTML content from other websites into your own page. The i stands for inline frame which means that it puts content from another website into that space on your webpage. It has a plethora of attributes that can be used to customize the embedded content and what functionality the content has within the context of the parent page. Here I had it embed the YouTube videos in the page and allowed them to have some classical functionality like autoplay, picture-in-picture, and fullscreen.
                <br>
                I also used the CSS counter-reset and counter-increment properties with the :before pseudo-element to number the video titles. This was a useful trick to number the videos without having to make the headers a numbered list, which would have made formatting the page to look the way I wanted significantly more difficult.
